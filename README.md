## What comes bundled with this repository

* Oauth2 server provided by laravel/passport.
* Simple Session API built on top of Oauth2 server
* Basic User model
* Custom composer scripts

## Composer scripts

All scripts must run inside Homestead or production environment:

* ```composer run-script test```  : run unit & feature tests
* ```composer run-script setup``` : setup application, install passport
